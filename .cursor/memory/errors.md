## Error #001: Railway Multiple Services Detection Issue

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Project:** gold-price-discord-bot  
**Environment:** production  
**Service:** Railway Deployment  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)

### Error Details:
```
Project: gold-price-discord-bot
Environment: production
Service: None
Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the `--service` flag.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### Context:
- Occurred during GitHub Actions workflow deployment to Railway
- Railway CLI detected multiple services in the project
- Deployment failed due to ambiguous service selection

### Root Cause:
Railway projects can have multiple services (web, database, etc.), and the CLI requires explicit service specification when multiple services exist.

### Solution Applied:
1. ✅ Added automatic service discovery using `railway service list --json`
2. ✅ Implemented `--service` flag with dynamic service name resolution
3. ✅ Added fallback logic for cases where service detection fails
4. ✅ Restored environment variable setting functionality
5. ✅ Enhanced error handling and logging throughout deployment process

### Code Changes:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Commit**: `c6efc5f` - "fix: resolve Railway multiple services deployment error"
- **Changes**: 
  - Added service listing step
  - Implemented dynamic service name detection
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Restored environment variable setting

### Prevention Rules Created:
- **File**: `.cursor/rules/railway-deployment.mdc`
- **Content**: Best practices for Railway service specification
- **Checklist**: Error prevention guidelines for future deployments

### Status: REOPENED ❌
**Issue**: Service detection logic failed, still getting "Multiple services found" error
**Latest Failure**: 2024-12-27 - Service name detection returned empty/null
**Commit Hash**: c6efc5f (attempted fix failed)
