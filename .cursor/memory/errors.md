## Error #001: Railway Multiple Services Detection Issue

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Project:** gold-price-discord-bot  
**Environment:** production  
**Service:** Railway Deployment  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)

### Error Details:
```
Project: gold-price-discord-bot
Environment: production
Service: None
Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the `--service` flag.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### Context:
- Occurred during GitHub Actions workflow deployment to Railway
- Railway CLI detected multiple services in the project
- Deployment failed due to ambiguous service selection

### Root Cause:
Railway projects can have multiple services (web, database, etc.), and the CLI requires explicit service specification when multiple services exist.

### Solution Applied:
1. âœ… Added automatic service discovery using `railway service list --json`
2. âœ… Implemented `--service` flag with dynamic service name resolution
3. âœ… Added fallback logic for cases where service detection fails
4. âœ… Restored environment variable setting functionality
5. âœ… Enhanced error handling and logging throughout deployment process

### Code Changes:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Commit**: `c6efc5f` - "fix: resolve Railway multiple services deployment error"
- **Changes**: 
  - Added service listing step
  - Implemented dynamic service name detection
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Restored environment variable setting

### Prevention Rules Created:
- **File**: `.cursor/rules/railway-deployment.mdc`
- **Content**: Best practices for Railway service specification
- **Checklist**: Error prevention guidelines for future deployments

### Status: IMPROVED FIX APPLIED ðŸ”„
**Issue**: Service detection logic failed, still getting "Multiple services found" error
**Latest Failure**: 2024-12-27 - Service name detection returned empty/null
**Previous Commit**: c6efc5f (attempted fix failed)

### Improved Solution (Commit: 062a536):
1. âœ… Added explicit Railway login with token
2. âœ… Used `railway deploy` instead of `railway up` (better service handling)
3. âœ… Improved service parsing with `tail -n +2 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'`
4. âœ… Added comprehensive fallback logic
5. âœ… Enhanced error reporting and debugging output

**Latest Failure**: 2024-12-27 - "Service 'list' not found" - Railway CLI syntax issue
**Error**: Railway CLI doesn't recognize `railway service list` command
