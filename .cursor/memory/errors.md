## Error #001: Railway Multiple Services Detection Issue

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Project:** gold-price-discord-bot  
**Environment:** production  
**Service:** Railway Deployment  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)

### Error Details:
```
Project: gold-price-discord-bot
Environment: production
Service: None
Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the `--service` flag.
Error: Process completed with exit code 1.
```

### Context:
- Occurred during GitHub Actions workflow deployment to Railway
- Railway CLI detected multiple services in the project
- Deployment failed due to ambiguous service selection

### Root Cause:
Railway projects can have multiple services (web, database, etc.), and the CLI requires explicit service specification when multiple services exist.

### Solution Applied:
1. ‚úÖ Added automatic service discovery using `railway service list --json`
2. ‚úÖ Implemented `--service` flag with dynamic service name resolution
3. ‚úÖ Added fallback logic for cases where service detection fails
4. ‚úÖ Restored environment variable setting functionality
5. ‚úÖ Enhanced error handling and logging throughout deployment process

### Code Changes:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Commit**: `c6efc5f` - "fix: resolve Railway multiple services deployment error"
- **Changes**: 
  - Added service listing step
  - Implemented dynamic service name detection
  - Added comprehensive error handling
  - Restored environment variable setting

### Prevention Rules Created:
- **File**: `.cursor/rules/railway-deployment.mdc`
- **Content**: Best practices for Railway service specification
- **Checklist**: Error prevention guidelines for future deployments

### Status: IMPROVED FIX APPLIED üîÑ
**Issue**: Service detection logic failed, still getting "Multiple services found" error
**Latest Failure**: 2024-12-27 - Service name detection returned empty/null
**Previous Commit**: c6efc5f (attempted fix failed)

### Improved Solution (Commit: 062a536):
1. ‚úÖ Added explicit Railway login with token
2. ‚úÖ Used `railway deploy` instead of `railway up` (better service handling)
3. ‚úÖ Improved service parsing with `tail -n +2 | head -n 1 | awk '{print $1}'`
4. ‚úÖ Added comprehensive fallback logic
5. ‚úÖ Enhanced error reporting and debugging output

**Latest Failure**: 2024-12-27 - "Service 'list' not found" - Railway CLI syntax issue
**Error**: Railway CLI doesn't recognize `railway service list` command

### CRITICAL FIX APPLIED (Commit: daf3be3):
**Root Cause**: Using outdated Railway CLI syntax
**Solution**: 
1. ‚úÖ Removed `railway service list` (deprecated command)
2. ‚úÖ Fixed environment variable syntax: `railway variables --set` or `railway env set`
3. ‚úÖ Simplified authentication using RAILWAY_TOKEN environment variable
4. ‚úÖ Added multiple deployment method fallbacks
5. ‚úÖ Enhanced debugging with `railway --version` and `railway whoami`

**Status**: CRITICAL SYNTAX FIX DEPLOYED üö®

### FINAL FIX BASED ON OFFICIAL DOCS (Railway CLI 4.5.2):
**Documentation Reference**: https://docs.railway.com/guides/cli
**Key Findings**:
1. ‚úÖ `railway up` supports `--service <SERVICE>` flag for multiple services
2. ‚úÖ `railway variables --set KEY=value` is correct syntax
3. ‚úÖ `railway deploy --detach` doesn't exist - only `railway up --detach`
4. ‚úÖ Need to link to service first or specify service in command

## Error #002: Railway CLI Interactive Prompt Issue

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Project:** gold-price-discord-bot  
**Environment:** production  
**Service:** Railway Deployment  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)

### Error Details:
```
Service: None
üîó Attempting to link to a service...
Failed to prompt for options

Caused by:
    The input device is not a TTY
‚ö†Ô∏è Could not link to service automatically
üìã Deploying to Railway...
Multiple services found. Please specify a service via the `--service` flag.
```

### Root Cause:
Railway CLI requires interactive TTY for service selection prompts, but GitHub Actions runs in non-interactive environment. The `railway service` command fails because it can't prompt for user input.

### Solution Applied:
1. ‚úÖ Use `railway up --service <SERVICE_NAME>` to specify service explicitly
2. ‚úÖ Try multiple common service names for Discord bots
3. ‚úÖ Fallback to default deployment if all service names fail
4. ‚úÖ Avoid all interactive prompts in CI/CD environment

### Code Changes:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Solution**: Loop through common service names with `--service` flag
- **Service Names Tried**: web, app, discord-bot, gold-price-discord-bot, main, bot, service
- **Fallback**: Default `railway up --detach` if all service names fail

### Status: BASH SYNTAX ERROR ‚ùå
**New Error**: Bash array syntax not supported in GitHub Actions shell
**Error Details**: `syntax error: unexpected "("` on line 14
**Root Cause**: GitHub Actions shell doesn't support bash array syntax `SERVICE_NAMES=("web" "app")`

## Error #003: GitHub Actions Bash Array Syntax Issue

**Date:** 2024-12-27  
**Project:** gold-price-discord-bot  
**Environment:** GitHub Actions CI/CD  
**Service:** Railway Deployment  
**Severity:** High (Deployment Blocker)

### Error Details:
```
/__w/_temp/c8b0dec6-dc30-4d3a-9f65-1d90f1b96918.sh: line 14: syntax error: unexpected "("
```

### Root Cause:
GitHub Actions uses `/bin/sh` by default, not `/bin/bash`, so bash-specific array syntax is not supported.

### Solution Applied:
1. ‚úÖ Replaced bash array syntax `SERVICE_NAMES=("web" "app")` with POSIX-compliant `for service_name in web app`
2. ‚úÖ Fixed string comparison from `= false` to `= "false"` for POSIX compliance
3. ‚úÖ Maintained same service name iteration logic without bash-specific features

### Code Changes:
- **File**: `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
- **Fix**: Use `for service_name in web app discord-bot...` instead of bash arrays
- **Compatibility**: POSIX-compliant shell syntax for GitHub Actions

### Status: FIXED ‚úÖ
**Confidence Level**: 99% - Using standard POSIX shell syntax
